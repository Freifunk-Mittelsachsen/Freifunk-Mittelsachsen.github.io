# Jekyll Rake Boilerplate

*Jekyll Rake Boilerplate* is a small rake "boilerplate" for doing common tasks with the static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), such as generating your site, preview it in your default browser, creating a new post or page from a default template and transfering it to a remote git repository, a remote host/server or a local git repository.

Please note that the code is intentionally "messy" and quite un-DRY so that'll be easier to take the parts that you want and toss away the others.

## Usage

### Tasks

    rake post\["Title"\]
	rake draft\["Title"\]
	rake publish
    rake page\["Title"\]
        rake page\["Title","Path/to/folder"\]
    rake build
    rake watch
        rake watch\[number\]
        rake watch\["drafts"\]
    rake preview
    rake deploy\["Commit message"\]
    rake transfer

`rake post["Title"]` creates a new post in the `_posts` directory by reading the default template file, adding the title you've specified and generating a filename by using the current date and the title.

`rake draft["Title"]` creates a new post in the `_drafts` directory by reading the default template file, adding the title you've specified and generating a filename.

`rake publish` moves a post from the `_drafts` directory to the `_posts` directory and appends the current date to it. It'll list all drafts and then you'll get to choose which draft to move by providing a number.

`rake page["Title","path/to/folder"]` creates a new page. If the file path is not specified the page will get placed in the site's source directory.

`rake build` just generates the site.

`rake watch` generates the site and watches it for changes. If you want to generate it with a post limit, use `rake watch[1]` or whatever number of posts you want to see. If you want to generate your site with your drafts, use `rake watch["drafts"]`.

`rake preview` launches your default browser and then builds, serves and watches the site.

`rake deploy["Commit message"]` adds, commits and pushes your site to the site's remote git repository with the commit message you've specified. It also uses the `rake build` task to generate the site before it goes through the whole git process.

`rake transfer` uses either `robocopy` or `rsync` to transfer your site to a remote host/server or a local git repository. It also uses the `rake build` task to generate the site before it goes through the whole transfering process.

      command: robocopy
      settings: /mir
      source: _site\
      destination: username@servername:\var\www\websitename\

### Remote transfer settings (for *nix)

    transfer:
      command: rsync
      settings: -av --delete
      source: _site/
      destination: username@servername:/var/www/websitename/

### Local transfer settings (for Windows)

    transfer:
      command: robocopy
      settings: /e
      source: _site\
      destination: C:\Git\username.github.com\

### Local transfer settings (for *nix)

    transfer:
      command: rsync
      settings: -av
      source: _site/
      destination: ~/Git/username.github.com/

## Known issues

Rake tasks doesn't play nice when it comes to including commas in arguments. For example, if you try to create a post by running `post["One, two, three"]` the name and title of the post will become `One`. The easiest work-around for this is to skip the commas when your creating a post and adding them later on.
